## Analysis 

### Product Sales Analysis

This page shows the summary of sales with filter on years and product categories with spotlight on products that customers are not spending on at all for reasons that cannot be fanthomed within the scope of this analysis.
Also Most Customers spend on products in the bike category.

### Customer Demographic Analysis

![](Customer_Demographic.jpg)

On this page I was able to analyse customer’s spending based on data on some demographic factors. The resulting analysis reflects that of the 18,480 customer details in the database, married customers spend more, contributing about 54% of the total product ordered, while single customers make up the remaining 46%. We could also note that customers without children spend more on SellCheapy’s Products.

Customers in the South west Terriory are the Highest spender and it could also be observed that they have the highest number of stores which shows that the more accessible product stores are, the more customers would be willing to spend.
This page also shows the top 10 and least 5 selling products

The following are conclusions deduced from the insight gained in the data provided:

-	The male gender spends more in all categories of products offered by SellCheapy Retail and are the highest purchaser of all categories of products

-	It is also worth noting that the middle-income earners spends more than others

-	By territory, customers from the southwest make the highest purchases. 

-	Generally customers spends more on purchasing new bikes than any other categories of products.

-	There is a relationship between the quantity order and number of stores by territory, showing that the higher the number of stores in each territory, the higher quantity of products ordered for across all categories.


### Recommendation

Based on the observation and conclusion derived in the course of this analysis, here are some corresponding recommendations:

-	Products that are female centric should be produced or some of the existing products can be rebranded to include some feminine touch so has to get more attention from the female gender.

-	The brand can focus more on promoting values of these products especially the component category where most of the least selling products belongs.

-	Brand should look into training the least selling salespersons and incentivize the top 10 highest selling salesperson to increase productivity and sales.

-	More stores should be open in territories with smaller stores.

-	Finally, brand should focus on targeting the middle-income earners and prospects within the age range 18-49 in her next marketing campaign for maximum result.
